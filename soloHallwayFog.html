    <p>Jacob Dekoksworth has chosen to venture into the fog. As he walks forward, the fog gets denser and denser and it gets harder and harder to see in front of him. Eventually, he hears a ghostly presence behind him saying "Return the slab! Or suffer my curse!" Jacob starts to panic because he knows its the ghost of King Ramses from Courage the cowardly dog; the ghost who wanders the earth for eternity to look for his slab. Jacob starts to run in the direction away the ghoul's voice and runs directly into a wall knocking him out cold.</p>
    <p>What becomes of Jacob is unknown and he was never found. Bad Ending!</p>
