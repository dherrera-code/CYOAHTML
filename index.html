            <p1>There was once a young and eager adventurer named Jacob Dekoksworth who desires fame and fortune more
                than
                anything. He learned of the art of sword fighting from the village he grew up in. During his training,
                Sir Dekoksworth realized he can earn fame and fortune by exploring dangerous places known as dungeons.
                He
                doesn't know anyone who has ever explored such a place and decides to move to a place known for
                adventurers
                called CodeStackdonia. Jacob discovers a dungeon location nearby want would like to explore as soon as
                possible.
                What should he do next? </p>
