    <h1>Calming down Ms. Kennifer!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Jacob attempts to calm down miss Kennifer by asking if she is okay. She explained how frustrated she is because she is looking for a man named Jose and claims that he is hiding a fortune inside this dungeon. Kennifer drags Jacob along back to the entrance of the dungeon and forces Jacob to help her seal the dungeon shut.</p>
    <p>Jacob and Kennifer sealed the dungeon and never gained any loot. Neutral Ending. </p>
