    <p>Jacob decides to walk in the well-lit path to see what is making those footstep sounds. As he heads forward, Jacob notices a shadowy figure running down the zig zagging hallway so he reacts by chasing down whoever is running. Jacob is lead into an end of a hallway with a door slowly closing down to cover the room's entrance. Without thinking, Jacob slides under the door before the room is completely sealed and sees Jose and a large computer set up. Jacob ask why does he have so many computers running here in this dungeon and Jose explains that he is mining Cryptos and needs a secret spot to mine them. Jose then bribes Jacob to keep this location a secret from anyone especially from a person named Kennifer who Jose himself is terrified of and gives Jacob compensation via bitcoin. </p>
    <p>Jacob is rich from this discovery and Jose's secret crypto mining operation is safe from anyone. Good Ending!</p>
