    <p>Jacob chose to continue down the corridor! While walking down into the dungeon, Jacob was filled with dread seeing the lighting getting dimmer and the hallway getting colder as he continues the path. Cobwebs and bones litter the path as he admires the stone work then he sees the stone corridor split into two. One path he can only see fog going all directions and the other path is more well-lit and can hear footsteps in the distance. It could be a person is roaming around the dungeon like yourself or it could mean danger from a monster or untrustworthy person. Maybe its better to go into the fog so you won't confront whoever it is.</p>
    <p>Which way should Jacob go? </p>
