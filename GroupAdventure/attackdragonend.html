    <p>You and your group surround the dragon, Ken throws a rock at the dragon you and Isaiah try to stab the beast
        but the scales are too thick you guys have only annoyed and woke the dragon. The dragon gets up and seems to be going for a slash so you all drop to the floor
        only for the dragon to shoot flames and burn you all to a crisp.
