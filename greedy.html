    <p> You know you need the money and fame all for yourself so you sneak up behind Isaiah hitting him in the back of the head
        quietly knocking him out. After that is done you try and sneak up to Ken but you can't find him. You look all over for Ken
        only to find him helping Isaiah up so you rush Ken only for Ken to pick up a boulder and launch it at you killing you in
        the process. What where you thinking?</p>
