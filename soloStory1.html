    <h1>Solo the Dungeon!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Jacob Dekoksworth has decided to try to fight a dungeon alone.</p>
    <p>Thinking that he didn't need any help, Sir Dekoksworth rushed into the nearby dungeon without any regard of his well-being. The entrance to the dungeon leads far underground and he walks down a staircase. He sees two door ways in front of him and sees a path that continues down the dungeon. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Sir Jacob has a choice to make: He sees one room containing goblins likely guarding some treasure,another room where you catch a glimpse of Kennifer; the beautiful elf lady dancer or he simply can continue down the corridor deeper into the dungeon! What should sir Dekoksworth do? </p>
